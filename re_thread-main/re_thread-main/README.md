### Target Problem To Be Solved

In today's fast-paced world, individuals often find their wardrobes cluttered with clothes that are no longer in use. These clothes take up valuable space and leave the owners unsure of how to dispose of them in a profitable and environmentally friendly manner. 
<br>
On the other hand, there are individuals who are unable to afford new clothes due to high market prices. The challenge is to bridge this gap and create a platform where owners can sell their pre-owned clothes, thereby decluttering their wardrobes and earning money, while buyers can purchase these clothes at reduced rates. This not only promotes sustainable living but also makes fashion more accessible and affordable. 
<br>
Thus problem to be solved is, the lack of a user-friendly, trustworthy, and efficient platform for selling and buying pre-owned clothes.
